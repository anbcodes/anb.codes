<h1 class="title">Observations About Stages of Learning</h1>
</header>
<p>Decemeber 18th, 2021</p>
<p>The following is a observation I had about the three stages of
learning, which I call the grammar stage, the dialectic stage, and the
rhetoric stage. All three together make up the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivium">trivium</a>.</p>
<p>Ok, so one day I was thinking about what I've learned about different
subjects, and also observing where other people were at in the same
subject. This led me to think about the different idea people believe
about a subject in the different areas. I noticed that in the grammar
stage everything feels strict, in the dialectic stage things start to
feel a little less strict, and in the rhetoric stage you feel free from
rules and can explore.</p>
<p>In the first stage, the grammar stage, everything feels strict and
ridged. During the grammar stage, you are learning the ground rules, the
basics. Because these ground rules are all you know, you have to follow
them strictly. As an example, when I started learning Latin, everything
felt pretty annoying, repetitive, and boring. I also didn't feel like I
would be able to just learn something new about it. I needed the book to
guide me. Because of this, I didn't feel free to experiment with the
language, and I actually just couldn't because of my limited knowledge.
Now this has changed as I've gotten more familiar with the language and
I will talk about that in the next few sections. So overall you can't
have fun with what your learning when you're in the grammar stage
because you don't know enough.</p>
<p>In the second stage, the dialectic stage, you start to be able to ask
questions about what you've learned, but you still can't answer you
questions so without a more knowledgable teacher it is still going to be
hard to explore. At this stage, you can start to see the fun in the
subject that you've been studying, but depending on the cirumstances you
still often get frustrated with it. In the dialectic stage, you start to
be expore but you're still quite limited.</p>
<p>In the last stage, the rhetoric stage, you are able to ask and answer
questions easily. This frees you from the rules, and allows you to have
fun with your knowledage. This is the funnest stage and the one you
should always be looking forward to. It takes a lot of effort to get to,
but, when you get there, it is worth it. From my experience, the
rhetoric stage gives you freedom. For example, I've been learning how to
write using a curriclum called Lost Tools of Writing (LTW). LTW teaches
you to write using three stages, invention, arrangement, and elocution.
Until recently, I wrote each of my papers by meticilulily following each
stage and rule. Figuring out what I'm gonna say, put it in one of their
outlines, and write it using their tools and styles. Now that I've
gotten more into the rhetoric stage. I've stopped strictly following the
rules. For example, I often combine the invention and arrangement. I
also write my own outlines and decide what parts I want to include.
Nothing feels strict, instead I feel like I am free to write however I
want, and it works!</p>
<p>Overall, this was very interesting to think about, and it should be
very encoranging to anyone just starting out at a new subject. It will
be strict and ridge for a while, but freedom does come, you just have to
earn it.</p>
