<p>Who should you trust and why? We live in a complex world, full of
competing authorities and ideas. Many people, both kids and adults, make
mistakes when choosing good authorities (myself included). They don’t
always check those authorities against evidence. This article will cover
who I trust, the difference between peers and authority, and how
authority should not be unchecked.</p>
<p>I trust many different people, and they have different levels of
trust. As a Christian, God and the Bible have unconditional trust, but
not without evidence. I respect my parents very much, and they have
authority over me, but God has authority over them as he is the ultimate
authority. Lastly, even though I don’t necessarily trust government
officals all the time, they are an authority in my life and deserve
respect. Therefore, I respect them.</p>
<p>Other people who are commonly trusted are peers. The problem with
giving a significant amount of trust to your peers is that most
information you get from them is either with barely any evidence or is
hearsay. Often stuff that I hear from peers (either my parent’s peers or
my peers) comes from a chain of one person telling another person
something and so on. If you’ve ever played a game of telephone, you’ll
know that a chain of people is not a very reliable way to convey
information. Context is removed, the ideas are reinterpreted, etc. With
social media, this is even worse, mainly because information can get
transformed by a chain of people even faster. Lastly, when information
comes from a chain of people or posts, it can become impossible to find
the original source, which means you can’t even discover what was
originally said. Because you can’t find the sources, the ideas can be
transformed, and it ends up being hearsay, peers should not often be
trusted unless you go back to the original source.</p>
<p>To clarify, I am not saying that all your friends are untrustworthy.
In the previous paragraph, I was talking about facts, but we often get
advice from our friends, not just facts. If you trust your friends to
give you sound advice, take it, your friends should be trustworthy in
that sense, but if your friends are telling you facts, it could be wise
to check their sources as they are generally not experts on that
subject. There is also a gray area between advice and facts. For
example, if someone bases their advice on facts you find to be untrue,
you probably shouldn’t take their advice. Overall, your peers can be
great a giving you advice, but it is a good idea to check their sources
when they tell you facts.</p>
<p>Lastly, all authorities should be fact-checked. Always look for more
sources saying the same thing, and if you find a source saying a
different thing, don’t dismiss it, even if it looks like it comes from a
source you don’t agree with, instead determine if they have reasons and
if the reasons are valid. I believe one way people get sucked into
misinformation is by believing that their source is trustworthy while
also believing that all other sources are wrong without even checking
their reasons. I, as a Christian, even check the Bible against evidence
(apologetics), and I don’t want to be believing everything I hear
blindly. You should check all authorities against other authorities and
evidence, and you shouldn’t ever dismiss opposing ideas without
thought.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I carefully choose who I trust, I don’t give much
trust to peers, and I check authorities against other authorities. You
have to trust some people, but you should be careful about who you
trust. Keep an open mind and don’t get stuck staring at only one side of
a debate. :::</p>
