## About me

Hello! I am a computer programmer. I know how to program in HTML, CSS,
Javascript, and Typescript. I have used Svelte and Vuejs for creating websites
(but this site is actually made with markdown files). I am not as good at C/C++
and Python, but I have written programs with them. I have also experimented with
Java, Rust, and Haskell, but I could not really use them in practice though Java
would not be too hard to learn.

I have some experience with cybersecuity. I\'ve done
[Cyberstart](https://www.cyberstartamerica.org/) and participated in the 2021
National Cyber Scholarship Competition, in which I scored
[21st](https://leaderboard.tomahawque.com/943e22be-870a-11eb-8e55-636337383761/359e5c0b1998ff3e19014cb3b9239f64/).
I also have
[GFACT](https://www.giac.org/certifications/foundational-cybersecurity-technologies-gfact/),
[GPEN](https://www.giac.org/certifications/penetration-tester-gpen/), and
[GCLD](https://www.giac.org/certifications/cloud-security-essentials-gcld/)
certifications from [GIAC](https://www.giac.org/).

I am also currently looking for web development contract work. I can create
responsive websites, simple web apps or prototypes. I can fix/develop existing
websites, and I can also scrape websites. Contact me for more information.

Lastly, I also write blog posts [here](/posts)
